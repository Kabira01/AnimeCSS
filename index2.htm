            <h3> ABOUT TEA</h3>
            <div class="flex">
                <p>Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of
        Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to China and East Asia. After water, it is the most
                    widely consumed drink in the world. There are many different types of tea; some, like Chinese
                    greens and Darjeeling, have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour, while others have
                    vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy notes. Tea has a stimulating
                    effect in humans primarily due to its caffeine content.</p>

            <h3>Tea Drinking In Azerbaijani Style</h3>
            <div class="flex">
                <img src="azeritea.jpg" alt="Azerbaijani-tea" />
                <p>Tea is most often associated with the British, but they might as well be Azerbaijanis.
“For the Azerbaijanis, drinking tea is a kind of addiction. We cannot live without tea,” Tahir Amiraslanov, head of the National Culinary Center in Baku, told Caspian News. 
No matter what the time of year or event, the fragrant beverage holds a special place in the country which is often called “the land of fire.” Tea ceremonies lay the foundation for auspicious occasions throughout one’s lifetime, such as marriage and childbirth.
Called chay in Azerbaijani, tea and tea customs reflect ancient traditions and local hospitality. Black tea is often served to guests, poured into the traditional armudu glass, or pear-shaped glass, said to keep tea hot at the bottom while helping it cool faster at the top, maintaining a constant temperature. 
Tea is sometimes spiced with cinnamon, cardamom leaves, or a piece of lemon or ginger to add some extra flavor. Although Azerbaijanis prefer drinking sweet tea, they do not put sugar directly into the drink; instead they dunk a sugar cube, then bite a piece off and sip their tea. This method is said to have medieval roots, when rulers who were afraid of being poisoned tested their tea by dunking a piece of sugar in the liquid that was supposed to react to the sugar if lethal.
The drink is often accompanied by serving fig, strawberry, apricot, walnut, blackberry and other jams. It is no wonder that locals drink tea with a snack, or as a dishleme, which means "bite" in Azerbaijani.  </p>
